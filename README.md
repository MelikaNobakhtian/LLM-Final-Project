**Project Title**

Enhanced SQL-RAG: A Comprehensive Framework for SQL Prompt Generation and Evaluation

**Description**

The goal of our project, ”Enhanced SQL-RAG:A Comprehensive Framework for SQL Prompt Generation and Evaluation,” is to develop an innovative system that leverages the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate SQL queries from natural language inputs. Our motivation stems from the significant challenge users face when accessing and querying relational databases due to the need for proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL). By addressing this barrier, we aim to democratize data access and enable a broader range of users to extract valuable insights from databases efficiently and accurately.
